        <p>
            In our Google Form we focused on getting feedback on the first impression of the design, and how intuitive it is.
            We asked whether or not it was easy to navigate through the website, and what the users think of the design.
            We wanted the website to be user friendly, and by asking the questions we did, we got necessary feedback so that
            we can improve the website with respect to the feedback we got.

        <h2>4. Test Audience</h2>
        <p>
            We sent the test to the person who made the brand as well as our common friends who have knowledge of the brand.
            They are in the same age group, and we see them as the target group for the products and website. We also asked
            fellow students to test the website, which also is the target group. 92% of the testers were females. 83% were
            in the age group 20-30, while 8% were between 50-60 and another 8% between 15-20. 83% of the testers were
            students, while 17% had a full time job.

        <h2>5. Testing Platforms</h2>
        <p>
            The users mostly used their own laptop, as well as their smartphones. 50% used smartphones and 50% used a computer.
            The users tested the website in Google Chrome and Safari, there was also 50/50 between Safari and Chrome.

        <h2>6. Feedback Summary</h2>
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>
            Most of the testers liked the design, and thought that the design and chosen colors fitted well with the products.
             Some of the comments were that they wanted to have the possibility to get more information about a chosen product
             and also bigger pictures.
        </p>
        <h4>Navigation</h4>
        <p>
            Almost everyone that tested the website thought that it was easy to navigate through the site, and that they easily
            found what they were looking for.
        </p>
        <h4>Content</h4>
        <p>
            Overall, the testers were happy about the content, but it might be necessary to give more information about prices
            and products while looking through the overview of all the jewelry.
        </p>
        <h4>Usability</h4>
        <p>
            From the feedback we got, there has to be more focus on making a user-friendly website. Most of them were happy,
            while others thought it was just okay. In addition, we got feedback on some bugs like some of the pages not working
            as planned on the phone, as well as the shopping cart not working exactly the way we planned.

        <h2>8. Self Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            In this project we have all gained a lot of new experiences. Our team consisted of students from different studies,
            age and grade level. We therefore learned a lot about teamwork across backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of us have learned a lot and got much more experience with GitHub and the terminal. We have been focusing on
             making branches on the different tasks to avoid merge-conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using Figma as a base for implementing our design in HTML and CSS, we have learned to think about design and
            ease of use.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have now, for the first time, used a real customer in the making of a website. This was interesting and
            educational. It was exciting having to focus on what the customer wanted, and not only what we wanted to implement on
            the website. This gave us a new perspective, and made us have to cooperate with the developers in the team and also
            with the customer during the whole project. Our focus was now on how to satisfy the customer and her needs for the
            website.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have gotten new experiences with user testing, and how to ask the right questions so that we get the feedback we
            are looking for. It is easy for the developers to emphasize different functions than the users, so the user testing
            is an important part of developing a website. We have also gotten experience with reflecting on the feedback we got,
             and what we would do differently in new projects and in further implementations on this particular project. We have
             also learned more about what we should emphasize in future projects.
