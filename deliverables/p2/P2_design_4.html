    <h2>3. Purpose and Goals </h2>

    The website's purpose is to expand the clients audience. The longer-term objective will be easier to achieve where the website will be strengthening the brand name, reaching out to and inform a larger portion of the target audience, and perhaps increasing sales. 

        <br><br>The target group is both girls and boys, of all ages, that use jewelries. The brand currently only has foothold in Oslo, but by creating the website, the company firmly thinks that its audience will grow and spread to other regions of Norway.

    <h2>4. Navigation Structure </h2>
      
    <p>
        The navigation structure of Frøken Oslo´s website can be described as clique, illustrated in site map in figure X.  
        <br>
        <br>The website has a hierarchy structure, as illustrated in the sitemap, with a top-down approach. The landing page for the website is the home page. Each top level page is referred too in the navigation bar / menu on the top of the layout on every page. Here you can access the sites home, shop and about, in addition to search and continue to your personal shopping cart. These pages represents each one category. To access the subcategory pages, a menu on the left site of the page will pop up for all belonging to the same category.  
    </p>
    <img src="img/structure.png">
    <p>
        The hierarchical structure is established because it is the easiest to understand. That will improve the usability of the website. It is also scalable as it is easy to further develop and scale up the content of the website. The navigation bar on the top will ease the navigation throughout the use of the website. This structure is also a familiar structure on online shopping sites, which increases the reasons for choosing it.
