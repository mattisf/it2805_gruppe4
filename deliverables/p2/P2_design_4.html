    <h2>3. Purpose and Goals </h2>

    The website's purpose is to expand the clients audience. The longer-term objective will be easier to achieve where the website will be strengthening the brand name, reaching out to and inform a larger portion of the target audience, and perhaps increasing sales. 

        <br><br>The target group is both girls and boys, of all ages, that use jewelries. The brand currently only has foothold in Oslo, but by creating the website, the company firmly thinks that its audience will grow and spread to other regions of Norway.

    <h2>4. Navigation Structure </h2>
      
    <p>
        The navigation structure of Frøken Oslo´s website can be described as clique, illustrated in site map in figure X.  
        <br>
        <br>The website has a hierarchy structure, as illustrated in the sitemap, with a top-down approach. The landing page for the website is the home page. Each top level page is referred too in the navigation bar / menu on the top of the layout on every page. Here you can access the sites home, shop and about, in addition to search and continue to your personal shopping cart. These pages represents each one category. To access the subcategory pages, a menu on the left site of the page will pop up for all belonging to the same category.  
    </p>

    </figure>
    
    
    <p>
        The hierarchical structure is established because it is the easiest to understand. That will improve the usability of the website. It is also scalable as it is easy to further develop and scale up the content of the website. The navigation bar on the top will ease the navigation throughout the use of the website. This structure is also a familiar structure on online shopping sites, which increases the reasons for choosing it.

    <h2>5. Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
    <p>
        Our main focus, when coming up with the design, was to make the website appealing for the target audience. We wanted a clean design, where it was easy for the users to navigate through the website, as well as getting all necessary information. The navigation bar and their informative tabs makes that possible. The producer, Sigrid A. Hole, wanted a design that complimented the logo, and the type of designs off the products, that is why we chose the colors and layout as we did.

    <ul>
        <li>Font: The font we use at the webpage is “Darker Grotesque”.</li>
        <li>Color Scheme:</li>
        <li>Text: Black</li>
        <li>Background: light pink (FCF6FC) on every page.</li>
        <li>Images: The product images on the homepage will have a tiny border with color B49D9D. The product images on the shopping page will not have any border, but they will become bigger while hovering over them.</li>
        <li>Body Width: 960px</li>
        <li>Links/buttons: The logo in det navbar will be a clickable link, which will bring the user back to the homepage. The buttons that refers to shopping will have the color B49D9D. On every link or button, the mouse will change when the user hovers over it. The buttons will also get a shadow underneath, a darker shade of the applicable button, when hovering over.</li>
        <li>Navbar position and its appearance: The navbar will be included at the top of every page. When the mouse hovers over the tabs, the mouse will change just like the mouse will with links and buttons. They will also turn a bit bigger when hovering over them.</li>
        <li>Footer: Created by: Sigrid A. Hole. Contact: s.a.hole@frokenoslo.com</li>
        <li>Background images: On the homepage we will use a bigger version of the logo with another lay out. On the other pages we will not use background images, because there will be product images and so on that are supposed to get all the attention.</li>
        <li>Logo: Our logo will be placed at the top of every page, in the middle, with menu tabs on each side of the logo. The logo will as mentioned be clickable.</li>

    <h2>6. Content</h2>

    There will be ten separate pages as follows: 

    <ul>
        
        <li><b>Homepage – homePage.html</b></li> 
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>This will be the page that appears first when the users visit the website. This page will give users a preview of some of the products available on the site, as well as a short introduction to the brand and how it all started.</li>
                <li>The page has a clean and appealing design. Although it includes some pictures and text, it will not get too overwhelming for the users. The users will get a taste of what the website is about, and because of the little amount of information on the homepage, the users will easily manage to navigate to the different pages in the navbar to see more of the products.</li>
                <li>The three pictures on the homepage represents the three different types of jewelry that can be found on the website. They are placed in the centered in the body, and will have a width from 388-400px and a height of 480.77px.</li>
                <li>At the bottom of the page there will be a box containing some information about the brand, with a short text and an artsy image representing the brand.
