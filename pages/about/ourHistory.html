          <p class="productText">“Frøken Oslo” is a Norwegian jewelry brand established by the producer itself, Sigrid A. Hole. The Oslo based designer started creating accessorizes to herself and her friends during Covid-19. It didn't take long for her desk to be covered in a scattering of vibrant stones and pearls. The response was enormous and increased immediately. That's when the notion of starting her own brand first emerged. The new brand was introduced in January 2022 after months of diligent design, prototyping, idea development, and other preparations.

            <br>
            Today, the collection consists of chains and rings, all of which may be mixed and matched to create custom jewelry. All of them combine beautiful design with a reasonable price point to appeal to both younger and more senior generations. Frøken Oslo firmly believes that all of the things they design, create, and sell should combine beauty and excellence.
