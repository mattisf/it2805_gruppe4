    <h2> Our Client </h2>
    
		<b>Client Name: Frøken Oslo</b> <br>
		<b>Contact Person: Sigrid Agnete Hole</b>
	
        <p>“Frøken Oslo” is a Norwegian jewelry brand established by the producer itself, Sigrid A. Hole. The Oslo based designer started creating accessorizes to herself and her friends during Covid-19. It didn't take long for her desk to be covered in a scattering of vibrant stones and pearls. The response was enormous and increased immediately. That's when the notion of starting her own brand first emerged. The new brand was introduced in January 2022 after months of diligent design, prototyping, idea development, and other preparations. 

          Today, the collection consists of chains and rings, all of which may be mixed and matched to create custom jewelry. All of them combine beautiful design with a reasonable price point to appeal to both younger and more senior generations. Frøken Oslo firmly believes that all of the things they design, create, and sell should combine beauty and excellence. </p>

    <h2> Purpose and Goals </h2>
      <p>
        The website's purpose is to expand its audience. The longer-term objective will be easier to achieve where the website will be strengthening the brand name, reaching out to and inform a larger portion of the target audience, and perhaps increasing sales. </p>

	<h2> Technical Difficulties </h2>
	
	<p>We plan to post many pictures in the gallery sections of our website, so we may 
	run into the technical problem regarding slowly-loading webpages. Such a website 
	will be frustrating for users, so we will need to make sure to avoid such a problem 
	by being conscious about the size and number of the photographs we use.
