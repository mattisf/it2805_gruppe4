    <h2> Our Client </h2>
    
		
		<ul>
		  <li>Client Name: Frøken Oslo
		  </li><li>Contact Person: Sigrid Agnete Hole
		</li></ul>
        <p>“Frøken Oslo” is a Norwegian jewelry brand established by the producer itself, Sigrid A. Hole. The Oslo based designer started creating accessorizes to herself and her friends during Covid-19. It didn't take long for her desk to be covered in a scattering of vibrant stones and pearls. The response was enormous and increased immediately. That's when the notion of starting her own brand first emerged. The new brand was introduced in January 2022 after months of diligent design, prototyping, idea development, and other preparations. 

          Today, the collection consists of chains and rings, all of which may be mixed and matched to create custom jewelry. All of them combine beautiful design with a reasonable price point to appeal to both younger and more senior generations. Frøken Oslo firmly believes that all of the things they design, create, and sell should combine beauty and excellence. </p>

    <h2> Specific Preferences </h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Nan Nan would like the website to have a simple, clean look, possibly white 
     with a texture. She would like such a background, because too complex of a
      background could potentially detract from the power of the artwork itself.
       She also believes that such a look would be more professional and reflect 
       the concept of this website as an artist’s website, more than just an art 
       school website which may have a more playful look to it. </li>
       
	 <li> Nan Nan would like to have her artwork displayed in sections. </li>
	 <li> Nan Nan and Geir Henbest have specifically told us that they would like to 
be able to modify the content of the website. Thus, we plan to use Javascript to 
write the content.  </li>
	 <li> The content of the website should emphasize the paintings and sculpture. </li>  
	 <li> If possible, our client would like to include some content in the local language,
 although this is not a requirement.  </li>
 
 </ul>
    </section>

    <h2> Final Location of the Website </h2>

 	<p> Geir Henbest will donate the domain name and the hosting fees. 
 He has informed us that the domain name will eventually be 
 www.nannanartstudio.com. </p>

	<h2> Technical Difficulties </h2>
	
	<p>We plan to post many pictures in the gallery sections of our website, so we may 
	run into the technical problem regarding slowly-loading webpages. Such a website 
	will be frustrating for users, so we will need to make sure to avoid such a problem 
	by being conscious about the size and number of the photographs we use.
